            <h2>Perustietoa</h2>
            <p>Magic the Gathering is a collectible card game owned by Wizards of the Coast. It is one of the oldest collectible card games, having been released in 1993. The player community is still very active, and new cards are continually being created.</p>
            <p>The game's concept is to build a deck from various cards and defeat your opponent.</p>
            <p>There are several formats in the game, determining the card legality in decks and the number of cards required.</p>
            <p>Its popularity is due to its flexibility. You can defeat your opponent in many ways, using Magic the Gathering's extensive gameplay mechanics and card library. Because of these extensive strategic options, each player can develop their strategies and decks to achieve their goals.</p>

            <h3>Standard</h3> 
            <p>Standard is a format where only cards from the last two years can be used in decks. The format is rotating, meaning when a new card set is released, the oldest one in the format is removed.</p>
            <p>This rotation ensures that the game evolves, and players have to update their decks and strategies regularly. However, it has been criticized for its repetitiveness as the best decks tend to dominate the season.</p>
            <p>In other words, creativity and innovation are not the strong points of this format.</p>
